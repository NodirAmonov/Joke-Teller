# Joke-Teller

##Thoughts

I have created text to speech projects in the past. This one was different in that it used a joke API to speak the joke. This was a pretty interesting project.\
It's a neat little app that can be fun for a few minutes listening to your computer tell you some jokes.

##Running this Locally

Go to the documentation page for the Voice RSS Text to Speech API page found [here](https://www.voicerss.org/tts/default.aspx)
Click on 'Get API Key' on the left nav bar.\
Create a free account.\
When your account is created, you need to activate the account by clicking the 'Activate Account' button on the sign up page.\
Once your account is activated, you can copy your API key and paste it into the script.js file.\
Line 18, replace 'config.MY_KEY' with your API key contained in single quotes.
